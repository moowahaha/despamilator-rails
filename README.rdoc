== DESCRIPTION:

FIX (describe your package)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* To fix the iconv error when developing with Ruby 1.9.2 and RVM,
  see: http://blog.footle.org/2010/07/29/installing-ruby-1-9-2-via-rvm-on-os-x/ .

== SYNOPSIS:

In your environment.rb:

    require 'despamilator_rails'

In your model (basic example):

    class YourModel < ActiveRecord::Base

      validates_with_despamilator :attributes => [:some_field] #=> causes an exception if "some_field" is spammy.

    end

Or, with some configuration...

    class YourModel < ActiveRecord::Base

      validates_with_despamilator :attributes => [:some_field], :threshold => 1 do |field, value, despamilator_instance|
        # do something useful
      end

    end

By default, an exception is thrown and the threshold is "1".

See the various examples in "spec/fixtures".
