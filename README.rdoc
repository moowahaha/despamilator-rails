* https://github.com/moowahaha/despamilator-rails

== DESCRIPTION:

FIX (describe your package)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* To fix the iconv error when developing with Ruby 1.9.2 and RVM,
  see: http://blog.footle.org/2010/07/29/installing-ruby-1-9-2-via-rvm-on-os-x/ .

== SYNOPSIS:

Somewhere (such as your environment.rb...)

   require 'despamilator_rails'

In your model (basic example):

   class YourModel < ActiveRecord::Base
     validates_with_despamilator :attributes => [:some_field]
   end

When "some_field" is assigned a spammy value, it will add to the errors. For example...

   YourModel.new(:some_field => spammy_value).save! #=> ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid exception!

Or...

   your_instance = YourModel.new(:some_field => spammy_value)
   your_instance.save
   your_instance.errors.full_messages.should #=> ["Some field looks like spam"]

If you want to configure the threshold (which defaults to 1) or add your own callback, you can do the following:

   class YourModel < ActiveRecord::Base
     validates_with_despamilator :attributes => [:some_field], :threshold => 1 do |field, value, despamilator|
       raise "spam! field: #{field}, value: #{value}, score: #{despamailtor.score}"
     end
   end

This example will...

   your_instance = YourModel.new(:some_field => "spammy string")
   your_instance.save! #=> Exception "spam! field: some_field, value: spammy string, score: 123"

The callback will receive the field name, the value and the instance of the Despamilator class.

See the various examples in "spec/fixtures".
